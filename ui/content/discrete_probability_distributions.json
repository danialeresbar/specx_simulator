    "description": "The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution of a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability p and the value 0 with probability q=1-p1. It is a special case of the binomial distribution where a single trial is conducted. It can be thought of as a model for the set of possible outcomes of any single experiment that asks a yesâ€“no question.",
